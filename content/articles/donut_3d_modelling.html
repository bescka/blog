<h2>Donut? 3d Modelling without a Graphics Engine</h2>
<p>In thinking about how one might go about visualizing objects on a html canvas with javascript I found 
  Andy Sloane's breakdown of his well known donut animation:</p>

<p>Andy provides a great walkthrough of the maths of rotation and projection,
  see the link below. Here is a go at implementing this for a cube! 
  </p>
  <h2>3D Cube Animation</h2>
<div style="text-align: center;">
  <canvas id="canvasCubeGrid" width="300" height="240"></canvas>

  <button id="startCubeGridButton">Start Rotation</button>
  <button id="stopCubeGridButton">Stop Rotation</button>
</div>
<p>It turns out that a torus is quite a nice shape to visualize, because the 
  donut effect is created by rotating a circle offset from the canvas center
  around an axis. The initialization for a cube in the implementation here is 
  slightly different because we instead start by iterating out a grid of points. 
</p>
<p>
  The light for the donut is interesting - it gets the normal to the surface
  of the torus from the vector to a point on the unit circle after applying the same
  transformation matrix, then projects this on to designated light 
  source for a shading number normalized between -1 and 1.  
</p>
<p>
  This approach doesn't work as simply for the cube because the normal
  to the surface is not the same as the vector running from the center to the edge
  of a 2d cross-section. Getting the normal to the surface of the cube requires a plane, 
  and the cheapest way to get this information is with triangles! 
  Definitely a next step! 
</p>
<h2>3D Cube Frame Animation</h2>
<p>Here is another initial attempt at rendering a cube using 
  a slightly different approach. The cube is rendered using fixed point 
  information, but only for the vertices. The edges are rendered after the
  transformation of the vertices by mapping the relevant lines connecting them. 
  The dots are just filled in along the line according to the number of 
  dots required and the length of the edge. I haven't done analysis on 
  compute time but I assume this way is far less expensive!
