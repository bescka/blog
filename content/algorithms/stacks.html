<h2>Stacks</h2>
<h3>Description</h3>
Similar to <a href="#/algorithms/queues">queues</a>. A stack operates on LIFO (last in first out). Here, elements are PUSHED or POPPED from the top/ most recently added end. PEEK shows the most recent element. Cormen et. al. give quite a nice analogy: 

<blockquote cite="">
    "These names are allusions to physical stacks, such as the spring-loaded stacks of plates used in cafeterias.
    The order in which plates are popped from the stack is the reverse of the order in which they were pushed onto the stack,
    since only the top plate is accessible"

<h3>Code Example</h3>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">
    class Stack<T> {
        private items: T[];

        constructor() {
            this.items = [];
        }

        // Push a new element onto the stack
        push(element: T): void {
            this.items.push(element);
        }

        // Pop an element off of the stack
        pop(): T | undefined {
            if (this.isEmpty()) {
                throw new Error("Stack is empty");
            }
            return this.items.pop();
        }

        // Peek at the top element of the stack
        peek(): T | undefined {
            if (this.isEmpty()) {
                throw new Error("Stack is empty");
            }
            return this.items[this.items.length - 1];
        }

        // Check if the stack is empty
        isEmpty(): boolean {
            return this.items.length === 0;
        }

        // Get the size of the stack
        size(): number {
            return this.items.length;
        }
    }
