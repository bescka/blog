<h2>Graphs</h2>
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>A graph, <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> is a set of vertices and edges that are connected. Using the notation of Cormen et. al, <span class="math inline">\(G = (V, E)\). <span class="math inline">\(|V|\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(|E|\)</span> denote the number of the respective elements. Graphs can be directed or undirected. That is, the possible direction of traversal between vertices can be specified or not.</span></p>

<!-- <h3>*TODO* Representing Graphs</h3> -->
<!---->
<!-- <p>Two common ways of representing graphs are using adjacency-list representations and adjacency-matrix representations.</p> -->

<h3>Graph Traversal</h3>

<!-- <h4>*TODO* Breadth-first search (BFS)</h4> -->
<!---->
<!-- <p>Take a source vertex, say <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span>. BFS will start by checking all immediate connections available to node <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> before checking the next layer of connections.</p> -->
<!---->
<h4>Depth First Search (DFS)</h4>

<p>For each vertex connected to the starting vertex (source), search along the path of connected vertices for as far as possible before moving to the next vertex connected to the source. Here is a generalized example for an undirected graph that returns all of the connected vertices:</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">class Graph {
    private adjacencyList: Map&lt;number, number[]&gt;;

    constructor() {
        this.adjacencyList = new Map();
    }

    addVertex(vertex: number): void {
        if (!this.adjacencyList.has(vertex)) {
            this.adjacencyList.set(vertex, []);
        }
    }

    addEdge(vertex1: number, vertex2: number): void {
        this.adjacencyList.get(vertex1)?.push(vertex2);
        this.adjacencyList.get(vertex2)?.push(vertex1);
    }

    dfs(start: number): number[] {
        const visited: Set&lt;number&gt; = new Set();
        const result: number[] = [];

        const dfsVisit = (vertex: number): void =&gt; {
            visited.add(vertex);
            result.push(vertex);

            const neighbors = this.adjacencyList.get(vertex);
            if (neighbors) {
                for (const neighbor of neighbors) {
                    if (!visited.has(neighbor)) {
                        dfsVisit(neighbor);
                    }
                }
            }
        };

        dfsVisit(start);
        return result;
    }
}</code></pre>

<!-- <p>Note: <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map">Maps</a> are great. They are iterable objects that remember the order of insertion useful properties here .size(), .has(), .get() and .set().</p> -->

<h4>Run through/ Usage:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Initialize the graph: <pre><code class="language-javascript">const graph = new Graph()</code></pre>
<li>Add some vertices. You can see in the addVertex function that these are just equivalent to numbers in the first level of keys in the adjacencyList: <pre><code class="language-javascript">graph.addVertex(1);
graph.addVertex(2);
graph.addVertex(3);
graph.addVertex(4);</code></pre></li> 
<li>Edges can then be added for any given vertex by assigning another vertex to the set of values in the adjacency list: <pre><code class="language-javascript">graph.addEdge(1,2);
graph.addEdge(1,3);
graph.addEdge(2,4);</code></pre> Note these are undirected edges because each edge add a connection both from the orgin to the destination and from the destination to the origin. If we were to set this up manually it would look something like this: <pre><code class="language-javascript">const adjacencyList = {
    1: [2, 3], 
    2: [1, 4], 
    3: [1], 
    4: [2]
};</code></pre></li>
</br>
<li>So, if we run:<pre><code class="language-javascript">console.log(`results: ${graph.dfs(1)})</code></pre> 
<ul>
<li>We initialize a new Set called visited and an array to store our result in.<pre><code class="language-javascript">visited = {}
result = []</code></pre> 
<li>We start the recursive dfsVisit at vertex 1 and add it to our list of visited vertices/ the results array. <pre><code class="language-javascript">dfsVisit(1)
visited = {1}
result = [1]
neighbours = [2, 3]</code></pre>
<li>Then we iterate on the neighbours. Starting with 2:<pre><code class="language-javascript">dfsVisit(2)
visited = {1, 2}
result = [1, 2]
neighbours = [1, 4]</code></pre>
<li>1 is in visited so iterate to the next neighbour, 4:<pre><code class="language-javascript">dfsVisit(4)
visited = {1, 2, 4}
result = [1, 2, 4]
neighbours = [2]</code></pre>
<li>2 is in visited and there are no more neighbours. Exit this level of the recursion and backtrack to 2.<pre><code class="language-javascript">dfsVisit(2)
visited = {1, 2, 4}
result = [1, 2, 4]
neighbours = [1, 4]</code></pre>
<li>1 and 4 are in visited. Exit this level of the recursion and backtrack to 1:<pre><code class="language-javascript">dfsVisit(1)
visited = {1, 2, 4}
result = [1, 2, 4]
neighbours = [2, 3]</code></pre>
<li>Access the next neighbour, 3:<pre><code class="language-javascript">dfsVisit(3)
visited = {1, 2, 4, 3}
result = [1, 2, 4, 3]
neighbours = [1]</code></pre>
<li>1 is in visited. Exit the recursion and return:<pre><code class="language-javascript">result: [1, 2, 4, 3]</code></pre>
</ul>
</br>
<h3>An application: Convexity</h3>
<p><a href="content/convexity/index.html">Convexity</a> uses DFS to assess the completeness of a group of connected vertices.</p> 

<p>The game uses a graph class for each set of connected vertices ("dots") called a "cluster". When 3 or more dots are connected - i.e. the minimum for 2d shape completion - and a cycle is found it flags the shape as completed. If this happens, additional checks are performed to see if the completed shape is convex or not (see <a href="#/articles/how_convexity_works">how convexity works</a>).</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">detectShapes() {
    const visited = new Set();
    this.completedShape = false;
    const dfs = (dot, startDot, path) => {
    
      // Base case for the recursion: 
      if (visited.has(dot)) {
        if (dot === startDot && path.length >= 3) {
          return path;
        }
        return null;
      }
      visited.add(dot);
      path.push(dot);
        
      // Recursion: 
      for (const neighbor of dot.connections) {
        const result = dfs(neighbor, startDot, path.slice());
        if (result) {
          return result;
        }
      }
      visited.delete(dot);
      return null;
    };

    for (const dot of this.dots) {
      const shape = dfs(dot, dot, []);
      if (shape) {
        this.completedShape = true;
        this.shape = shape;
        this.isConvex = this.checkConvexity();
        return shape;
      }
    }

    return null;
  }
</code></pre>
<p>For the following cluster:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">   1
  / \
 2   4
  \
   3
</code></pre>
<p>The steps would look like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Start at 1:<pre><code class="language-javascript">visited: {}
path: []
call: dfs(1,1,[])
visited: {1}
path: [1]</code></pre>
<li>Go to first neighbour from 1: [2, 4] -> 2.<pre><code class="language-javascript">call: dfs(2, 1, [1])
visited: {1, 2}
path: [1, 2]</code></pre>Go to neighbours from 2: [1, 3] -> 1. 1 is source but path <= 3 so go to next neighbour: 3.<pre><code class="language-javascript">call: dfs(3, 1, [1, 2])
visited: {1, 2, 3}
path: [1, 2, 3]</code></pre>
<li>3 has one neighbour, 2. 2 is visited, but not source. Exit recursion level to 2:<pre><code class="language-javascript">visited: {1, 2} // from visited.delete(dot)
path = [1,2] // from path.slice() copy at level</code></pre>
<li>No more neighbours for 2. Exit recursion level to 1.<pre><code class="language-javascript">visited: {1} // from visited.delete(dot)
path = [1] //from path.slice() copy at level</code></pre>Check second neighbour from 1: [2, 4] -> 4.<pre><code class="language-javascript">call: dfs(4, 1, [1])
visited: {1, 4}
path: [1, 4]</code></pre>
<li>4 has neighbours [1], which is source but path >= 3 elements. No more items to check. Exit recursion via base case, returning null. Visited.has(dot) but not >= 3 elements.
