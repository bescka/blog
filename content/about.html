<h2>About Me</h2>

<p> Hi! I'm Ben. I am a data analyst and aspiring fullstack developer with a background in economics.</p> 

<p> I moved towards data analytics after COVID after finding I enjoyed implementing computational models and statistics with the likes of MATLAB, R and STATA. Working in the area introduced me to Python and SQL for data transformation, exploration and predictive analytics.</p>

<p> Being in the field has meant I've worked on teams with talented developers and have been working on skills in web development to build data driven tools that solve problems.</p>
